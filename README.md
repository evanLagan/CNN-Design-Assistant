# Web-Based CNN Design Assistant

## About

Developed an application that simplifies the design, training, and visualization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks.

- **Beginner-friendly Interface:** Abstracted the complex coding workflow required for training CNNs into an intuitive UI, allowing users with little to no experience in deep learning to easily train models without writing code.
- **Key Features:**
  - Dataset upload functionality
  - Intuitive, layer-by-layer model creation
  - Training progress visualization
  - Ability to export Python code for advanced workflows
